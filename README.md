- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com/))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   cd CMPE282-HW1

4. **Install dependencies:**

   npm install

5. **Start the development server:**

This runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

**How to Play:**
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
Two players take turns playing by entering their symbol (X or O) in an empty square.
The first player to get 3 of their symbols in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
